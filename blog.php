<h3>2014 10 31:<br><br> Why is Hope Taylor, Executive Director of Clean Water for NC, 'unhappy' with findyourfracker.org?</h3>

<p>
Our final take on this:<br>
Politics are complicated, factual, unbiased voting history is not.  Hope appears upset that findyourfracker.org labels one of her favorite representative as a fracker since he voted in favor of a pro-fracking bill. 
</p>

<p>
We're sorry Hope, but we just report the facts.
</p>

<p>
 We believe that working in collaboration with other organizations toward a common goal is much more effective than working against them.  So, to CWFNC and all the other anti-fracking, clean-water promoting organizations in NC, let's find a way to work together to make the enfironment better for everyone in.

We became aware of a note aparently sent by Hope Taylor to several anti-fracking organizations with some inaccuracies that we wanted to take the time to report the facts on here.  We don't know the name of the administrator for the Coaltition Against Fracking in Western NC Facebook group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NoFrackinginWNC" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/NoFrackinginWNC</a>  But they forwarded this note to us in response to a press release last week:<br><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
from Hope at Clean Water for NC. I trust her: BEWARE OF THIS WEBSITE,
 PLEASE, and do NOT forward it until you.ve checked out the following
 problems.. I.ve tried twice to communicate about very misleading
 results to Peter, but he has not taken it seriously.

 He has rated at .Fracker. legislators who have voted AGAINST S786, but
 have voted for any one of the following very complex bills from
 EARLIER sessions, S76, H74, S127. This is highly misleading and
 manages to rank several great allies such as Floyd McKissick and
 Earline Parmon as .Frackers..

Furthermore, he even uses the wrong name for our House of
 Representatives, calling it our .NC State Assembly..

I can.t speak to this as a tool for other states, but I am appalled
 that someone would send something like this out without doing more
 checking on the results with folks familiar with their own state
 legislators or even getting the right name for the legislative body!

</blockquote>

<p>
As evidenced by our e-mail corespondence with Hope below, we have taken her concerns seriously but didn't find the fact that a bill was "confusing" to be any excuse for a state respresentative to be forgiven for voting in favor of it.
</p>

<p>
According to the former Chair of the politicl science department at Mars Hill University, use of the NC General Assembly is correct nomenclature for the state house of representatives.  Since it appeared this was confusing to some people however, at Hope's suggestion, we changed the site to use the more common reference of 'NC House of Representatives'.  This has been in place since two days after Hope mentioned it to us, but I guess she didn't bother to check on that before defaming findyourfracker.org. 
</p>

<p>
You'll notice in the e-mail thread that we did address all of her concerns in detail, and even asked for further clarification of bills, especially SB76, to which we received no reply from Hope.
</p>

<p>As stated on our 'about' page, we lable any representative who votes in favor of any pro-fracking legislation as  a 'fracker'.  It's up to the users fo the site to decide then, by looking in detail at each representatives voting record, if they are the right choice for them.

<p>Hope,</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments regarding findyourfracker.org.</p>

<p>While our opinions differ on how representatives should be labeled, fundamentally I believe we are both working toward creating a safer, more sustainable future for North Carolina.</p>

<p>The site is not perfect, I have yet to find one that is. We have done our best to clearly present factual information on how representatives have voted, and we state clearly on the 'about' page of the site, that all pro-fracking votes result in a label. We had a significant amount of assistance from Food and Water Watch in choosing pro-fracking legislation to track. It's up to constituents to determine their tolerance level of pro-fracking votes. We are just organizing and reporting the actual data.</p>

<p>In direct response to your concerns however, we have added a note that makes it more clear that you can click on a representative thumbnail to get more detailed information on the bill that was voted on, as well as see a list of all fracking related bills voted on and how they voted. We have also added a legend to explain the color grading of the label to some degree.</p>

<p>Sure, we could 'change the rules' and 'not count' pro-fracking votes that occurred before the latest SB 786 vote, but I'm not sure that would be all that much different than the recent re-redistricting of NC. Apologies for the apples to oranges comparison there, but you see my point. I do believe that all votes are important, and that legislators should not vote in favor of a bill if it is not well understood--and that any pro-fracking vote deserves an explanation--which thankfully the open forum of politics allows in abundance.</p>

<p>Direct from the site: Our mission is to encourage rational, science-based legislation by providing easy access to factual information for the constituents of legislators who are charged with making decisions that directly impact our health, our land, and our welfare--in short, to promote a healthy democracy with an educated electorate.</p>

<p>Our site is a tool, and the use of any tool assumes some personal responsibility, and without some of this personal responsibility, individuals are actually prohibited from using the site as outlined on our 'terms and conditions' page, which closes with: &quot;...and recommend that you verify the system's search results and presented information independently to insure an informed, well rounded view of your representatives actions.&quot;</p>

<p>If your organization chooses not to support our endeavors, that is surely your prerogative. Working together however, I feel confident we can have a much greater impact on restoring the legislative balance in North Carolina than otherwise. Should the deficiencies of each our organization's approach to scoring legislators on fracking be brought to light? Absolutely. But I don't believe that this is necessarily a barrier for productive collaboration towards our common goal of keeping representatives that work toward a clean environment in service, and I look forward to any chance we may have to work together to both improve findyourfracker.org and support the anti-fracking community in NC.</p>

<p>I do hope that we can productively work together to restore the legislative balance in NC and stop the dangerous practice of fracking before our land and water is permanently damaged.</p>

<p> Sincerely,</p>

<p>Peter Brezny www.findyourfracker.org</p>

<p>PS I've responded to some of your comments in line below to make sure I didn't leave anything out.</p>

<p>>Other errors in Find Your Fracker, aside from what I had described in my first message are:</p>

<p>1) It&rsquo;s the NC House of Representatives, not the &ldquo;NC State Assembly&rdquo;. 
<br>
FYF reply:
<br>

Thanks very much for this. We will correct it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>> 2) I haven&rsquo;t found the specific vote on SB76 that corresponds to the yes votes that you&rsquo;ve flagged for your ratings. Please cite the specific vote you&rsquo;ve referred to, as there were many of them, on all sorts of amendments and conference committee reports on this bill. I&rsquo;ve alerted our NC League of Conservation Voters of these problems with &ldquo;Find Your Fracker&rdquo;. 
<br>
FYF reply:
<br>

We rely heavily on the 'sunlight API' for collecting this data. We chose to only use final bill votes for the rating.</p>

<p>> 3) In searching around the state, we&rsquo;ve found many other NC legislators that we consider strong allies who all voted against SB 786 but were flagged by Find Your Fracker for a single &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on either SB 76, H74 or SB 127, which were all complex bills with many facets. You have them all labeled as &ldquo;frackers&rdquo; (orange), the same rating given to very problematic legislators who have voted for 3 out of 4 bad bills. This further compounds the misleading nature of your results.  
<br>
FYF reply:
<br>

We will consider a broader range of 'degres of pro-fracker' however, this might best be left upto constituents to evaluate on their own. It is a shame that some anti-fracking legislators chose to vote in favor of pro-fracking legislation.</p>

<p>> This tool targets some excellent legislators with inappropriately applied information and frankly does a disservice to the anti-fracking movement in NC! We will be explaining the misleading nature of your results to our statewide FrackFree NC list this week, and we fear that some excellent legislators will face unfounded attacks and perhaps lose votes due to your ill-informed labelling. 

<br>
FYF reply:
<br>

I'll disagree with your first statement here. We have reported actual votes, and it is widely accepted that the bills we have flagged as pro-fracking are in fact so. If, however, we are inaccurately reporting a yes vote that was actually no, please let us know. We don't consider legislators who voted in favor of pro-fracking legislation 'excellent'.</p>

<p>> We hope that you&rsquo;ll open your mind and seek further input on your legislative vote choices and the consequences of your ratings, and remove NC from your map as you consider the consequences of how you&rsquo;ve set this up. 
<br>
FYF reply:
<br>

Likewise.</p>

<p>> Again, the relevant vote, given the recent history and rapidly evolving perceptions of fracking in NC is the one on SB 786 this year, see: http://frackfreenc.org/follow-legislator-s786-fracking-bill/ [1] . This is the most representative and informative vote for citizens to make a decision on the current stance of their legislator on the fracking issue.  

<br> 
FYF reply:
<br>
All votes are relevant, and our constituents have a civic obligation to understand legislation before they cast a vote, regardless of how 'complex' it may be.</p>

<p>FROM: info@findyourfracker.org [mailto:info@findyourfracker.org] SENT: Tuesday, September 16, 2014 9:07 AM TO: Hope Taylor SUBJECT: Re: FFNC partner, NOT until you fix ratings!!</p>

<p>Hope,</p>

<p>Thanks for the additional information about SB76.</p>

<p>Looking at the summary however, it appears this bill authorizes off shore drilling and allows NCDENR to issue permits for fracking itself. I&rsquo;m not sure how this bill could be considered anti-fracking legislation.</p>

<p>http://votesmart.org/bill/16263/46111#.VBg2vfldW3k [2]</p>

<p>Could you provide additional information about SB76, and any documentation showing established environmental organizations support for this bill?</p>

<p>As we state clearly on the site, any pro-fracking vote gets a fracker label. It&rsquo;s up to individuals to click on their legislator to see more detail on how they voted, and decide on their own how to act. I&rsquo;m glad to see McKissick voted against all the other associated bills.</p>

<p>We welcome your input with additional supporting documentation establishing SB 76 as an anti-fracking piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>FROM: Hope Taylor SENT: &#8206;Monday&#8206;, &#8206;September&#8206; &#8206;15&#8206;, &#8206;2014 &#8206;11&#8206;:&#8206;04&#8206; &#8206;AM TO: info@findyourfracker.org CC: Katie@cwfnc.org</p>

<p>This is Hope Taylor, exec. Director of Clean Water for NC, and informally the coordinator of FrackFree NC Alliance.</p>

<p>I entered my own address to see how your system worked and was astonished to see that my own state Senator, Floyd McKissick, was listed as a FRACKER. I DISAGREE HEARTILY, he has been adamant about this issue for years. I see that &ldquo;Fracker&rdquo; listing was based ONLY on a yes vote on SB 76, on which some fracking opponents voted yes because a long-negotiated bill was substantially improved, including actually STRENGTHENING the landmen registry, the moratorium language, and reaffirming a prohibition against frack waste disposal by deep injection.</p>

<p>At the very least, you need to remove SB 76 (2013) from your scan, as this is obviously leading to a serious misinterpretation of legislators&rsquo; overall stands on the issue.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
