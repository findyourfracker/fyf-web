	<h2>About This Site</h2>
	<p>This site makes it easy for you to identfy your 'Frackers'--any representative who has voted in favor of pro-fracking legislation.&nbsp; Just click on the map in the search window, or type in your zipcode and click on a legislator to see how it works.</p>
	<p>The map outlines the voting district for each representative as well.&nbsp; Click on one of the representatives in the list for more information about them, including a list of pro-fracking legilsation they voted on, and the map will display the district they represent.&nbsp; Note that voting districts don't follow zipcode boundaries and your full address may be needed to accurately display the representatives within your specific voting districts.</p>
	<p>This site has no political affiliation and is dedicated to the distribution of factual legislative data and science based information regarding Fracking.&nbsp; No contribution to the development of this site will have any impact on our dedication to the clear presentation of factual, science-based reality of fracking and how our representatives have or have not supported it.</p>  
	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p>Our mission is to encourage rational, science-based legislation by providing easy access to factual information for the constituents of legislators who are charged with making decisions that directly impact our health, our land, and our welfare--in short, to promote a healthy democracy with an educated electorate.</p>
	<p>We label legislators who have voted in favor of any pro-fracking legislation as frackers and recommend they be voted out of office.&nbsp; We are not interested in changing their minds.&nbsp; This is not rocket science.&nbsp; Everyone knows not to poison their well.&nbsp; If a legislator has voted in favor of fracking, it's time for them to go.</p>
       <p>All research, design, development, and programming for the initial release of findyourfracker.org has been performed by volunteers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have the site functioning with data for North Carolina, we want to expand the site to cover every state in the nation at risk of, or currently being fracked.&nbsp; Please consider <a href="<?php echo $baseurl; ?>/contribute-to-stop-fracking">contributing</a> to our efforts.</p>
